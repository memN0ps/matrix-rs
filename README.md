A lightweight, memory-safe, and blazingly fast Rust-based type-2 research hypervisor for Intel VT-x, focused on studying the core concepts of virtualization.

## Features

- Efficient VM exit handling: `CPUID`, `RDMSR` & `WRMSR`, `INVD`, `RDTSC`, `XSETBV`.
- Custom GDT and IDT setup, partially complete with ongoing development for new Page Tables. [Learn more](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/2779560-post4.html).
- Uses `ntoskrnl.exe` CR3 (Directory Base Table) for the host CR3 configuration.
- Integrated Extended Page Tables (EPT) with Memory Type Range Registers (MTRR), ensuring optimal memory mapping and type management.

## Planned Enhancements

- Enhanced VM Exit Instruction Handling, including `EptViolation`, `EptMisconfiguration`, `GETSEC`, and VMX instructions like `INVEPT`, `INVVPID`, `VMCALL`, `VMCLEAR`, `VMLAUNCH`, `VMPTRLD`, `VMPTRST`, `VMRESUME`, `VMXOFF`, `VMXON`.
- Development of EPT hooks for advanced memory control and monitoring in guest VMs.
- Resolve a critical issue where the hypervisor causes a `CRITICAL_PROCESS_DIED (ef)` BSOD after running for a minute, aiming to enhance system stability and reliability.

## Installation

1. Install Rust from [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
2. Switch to Rust Nightly: `rustup toolchain install nightly` and `rustup default nightly`.
3. Install LLVM: `winget install LLVM.LLVM`.
4. Install Tools: `cargo-make`, `cargo-expand`, `cargo-edit`, and `cargo-workspaces`.
5. Install WDK/SDK/EWDK: Steps [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/download-the-wdk).

## Building the Project

- Development: `cargo make --profile development`.
- Production: `cargo make --profile release`.

## Debugging

### Enabling Debug Modes

- Test Mode: Activate test signing with `bcdedit.exe /set testsigning on`.
- Windows Debugging: Follow the steps in this [Microsoft guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/bcdedit--bootdebug).

```powershell
bcdedit.exe /bootdebug {bootmgr} on
bcdedit.exe /bootdebug on
bcdedit.exe /debug on
```

### Network Debugging with Windbg

Setup: `bcdedit.exe /dbgsettings net hostip:w.x.y.z port:n`.

### Debug Print Filter

1. Open `regedit.exe`.
2. Go to `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager`.
3. Create `Debug Print Filter` with `DEFAULT` DWORD = `8`.

### VMware Serial Port Debugging

1. Add Serial Port in VMware: 'Use output file'.
2. Configure in Windows VM: `$serialPort = New-Object System.IO.Ports.SerialPort COM2,9600,None,8,One; $serialPort.Open()`.

### Service Management

Use Service Controller (`sc.exe`) to create and manage the hypervisor service:

```powershell
sc.exe create matrix type= kernel binPath= C:\Windows\System32\drivers\matrix.sys
sc.exe query matrix
sc.exe start matrix
```
